	<p>A View from the Bridge is a play set in Brooklyn in the 1950s and was written by Arthur Miller. He wrote this play based on different aspects in his life as he lived in Brooklyn as a child and worked in the Brooklyn shipyards like Eddie and befriended the Italians he worked with. Miller heard a story of some men coming over to work illegally and being betrayed which inspired him to write A View from a Bridge. It was originally a one act play, but he changed it into a two-act play later on. The play includes ideas from Greek tragedies, which is where the character of Eddie links into. Alfieri, another main character acts as a Greek chorus, a vital role in a Greek tragedy and he watches the action, comments on it and talks to the audience directly, like a narrator. We see him in many different roles throughout the play and each role adding to the dramatic impact of the play.

		<h2><strong>NEW-ZELAND</strong></h2>
	<p>The title of the play ‘A View from a Bridge’ has many different meanings, as it could be seen as Alfieri’s ‘view from the bridge,’ as he is the one narrating the events and telling his view on the events that unfold. Furthermore the title is literally the play, which is set in Brooklyn Bridge and is about the community around the area and the actions that happen which Alfieri tells as a narrator. Also the bridge could be a metaphor for the differences between Alfieri’s view on justice and Eddie’s differing opinions and can also incorporate Alfieri’s view that we should ‘settle for half’ as to do this you may need to compromise and meet in the middle, like the middle of the bridge. Another interpretation on the title is that the ‘bridge’ is like a bridge between Eddie’s community in Brooklyn and Marco and Rodolpho’s community in Italy and they both have to understand each other’s way of life by using this bridge to help them.

	In the first scene when Alfieri meets with Eddie as a lawyer he describes Eddie’s eyes “like tunnels.” This simile gives the impression of a dark journey ahead of Eddie and gives the audience an image that Eddie cannot escape his fate that has been predicted by Alfieri as the audience already know it’s going to happen. It could also suggest that Eddie was thinking deeply or that he had many dark feelings rushing around his head. In this scene Alfieri is powerless to prevent what is going to happen and this creates tension and suspense because the audience want to know what is going to happen next. “I could see every step coming, step after step.” Alfieri also acts as a warning sign, by preparing the audience for events that are about to happen. “You won’t have a friend in the world, Eddie!” By using the phrase ‘you won’t’ Alfieri is warning Eddie that something is definitely going to happen and that he should be careful. “As the weeks passed, there was a future; there was a trouble that would not go away.” By using repetition, Alfieri is emphasizing the point that something is going to happen and is making the audience think through what will happen and why and therefore keeps them hooked. Arthur Miller uses dramatic irony as the audience and Alfieri know something is going to happen, however the characters in the play are oblivious to this.

	<p>
		The setting of Red Hook is a poor community and Alfieri creates the atmosphere of Red Hooks by describing it as “the slum that faces the bay seaward side of Brooklyn Bridge.” There is a lot of cultural context linked into the story as Alfieri comes from the same Italian background as Eddie; therefore he understands both American and Italian lifestyles and he helps the audience to understand the 1950’s Brooklyn society in which the characters live. Alfieri also explains how the rich and the poor are divided in their community by their jobs and states that Eddie has a hard job as “a longshoreman working on the docks.”
		“I often think that behind that suspicious little nod of theirs lie three thousand years of distrust.” This is a quote that Alfieri says at the beginning of the play which gives the audience an insight into what Red Hook is like and suggests that there is a lot of dishonesty in the area. He mentions the characters Al Capone and Frankie Yale who were former Italians that had a history of crime and violence, “In those days, Al Capone the greatest Carthaginian of all was learning his trade on these pavements, and Frankie Yale himself was cut precisely in half by a machine gun”, he uses this quote to emphasise the case that he is about to handle which shows that it will be of violent nature and he also uses this quote to show that the play will end tragically.

		<h2><strong>GERMANY</strong></h2>
	<p>The audience sees Alfieri as a character in the play when Eddie goes to see him for advice. However Alfieri feels that he cannot help Eddie as he knows about the disaster that is going to happen at the end of the play so he feels powerless over Eddie as his friend and his lawyer and cannot prevent the decisions Eddie is choosing to make. Another role Alfieri takes on which is a very important part in the play is as a moral commentator. Alfieri gives his own views and opinions on the characters and their actions and this guides the audience rather than allowing them to make their own minds up. The audience has the same opinion of the narrator because Alfieri talks directly to them affecting their view on the situation and characters and they believe everything he says. Alfieri comments on Eddie’s moral character saying “he was as good a man as he had to be in life that was hard and even,” and he explains that Eddie is neither entirely good nor entirely bad. Alfieri only guides the audience influencing their opinion, but sometimes gives two differing opinions on Eddie allowing the audience to make up their own minds.

		<h2><strong>BARCELONA</strong></h2>
	<p>In the play there are only two acts, which is unusual for a play; however there is many different things that happen in these two acts. As an audience we see that Alfieri is very important to the structure of A View From A Bridge as he is the character that opens the play and ends the play with his two dramatic speeches therefore adding to Alfieri’s dramatic impact to the play.
	Finally Alfieri acts as the Greek chorus in the play, explaining the events on stage to the audience without actually participating in them. He has to know a lot about each of the main characters and actions to be an effective chorus; however he communicates with the audience more thoroughly than with the characters, to inform them of the actions and thoughts of the characters. The idea of the narrator was developed in the Greek tragedies of the 5th century called the chorus who commented on the actions of characters in the play which is like Alfieri. A Greek Tragedy was originally a play that consisted of tragic events with a main character (like Eddie) who’s fate would soon come to an end and usually die at the end. A View from a Bridge uses the conventions of a Greek Tragedy, as Arthur Miller used a final climax in the play where Eddie Carbone (one of the main characters) tragically dies, which suggests his play is based on a traditional Greek tragedy.
